The Back In Stock Settings API allows you to manage whether or not to collect requests from customers to receive back in stock notifications. 

Learn more about [back in stock notification settings](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-stores-notifying-customers-when-products-are-back-in-stock#collecting-customer-requests).

To use the Back In Stock Settings API, import { backInStockSettings } from the ‘wix-ecom-backend’ module:
``` javascript 
import { backInStockSettings } from `wix-ecom-backend`;
```

## Before you begin
It’s important to note the following points before starting to code:
+ To start collecting back in stock requests, the `collectionStates` must be set to `true`. Use [`startCollectingRequests()`](wix-ecom-backend/backinstocksettings/startcollectingrequests) to update collection states.
+ [Customize the design of the notification email](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-stores-notifying-customers-when-products-are-back-in-stock#customizing-the-notification-email) that will be sent.

## Terminology
+ **Collection state:** The collection state determines whether the selected app is actively collecting requests for back in stock notifications. When the collection state is set to `true``, collecting requests is enabled and customers may request notifications for out of stock products.

## Permissions information
The following functions in Back In Stock Settings API are restricted and only run if you elevate permissions using the `wix-auth` [`elevate()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-auth/elevate) function:

+ [`startCollectingRequests()`](wix-ecom-backend/backinstocksettings/startcollectingrequests)
+ [`stopCollectingRequests()`](wix-ecom-backend/backinstocksettings/stopcollectingrequests)
