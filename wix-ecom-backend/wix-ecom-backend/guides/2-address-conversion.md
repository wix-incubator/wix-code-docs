title: Address Object Conversion Table

# Stores to eCommerce Address Object Conversion Table

The eCommerce APIs use a different `address` object to the one used in the Stores APIs. Notably, fields related to contact information have been moved
to an adjacent `contactDetails` object (for example, in `order.shippingInfo`).

To help with conversion and migration, refer to the table below to check which fields have changed and how.

Fields that remain with the same name, in the same location, and with no changes in behavior are marked with an asterisk (*).

> **Note:** In the eCommerce APIs, the buyer's email is only held in the `buyerInfo` field in the order object.
