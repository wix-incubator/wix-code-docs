The Order Invoices API allows you to retrieve the IDs of invoices, and IDs of the external invoice apps that created them.


## Terminology

+ __Invoice ID__: Used to retrieve the invoice itself from the service that created it.
+ __Invoice App ID__: ID of the external invoice app that created the invoice.

To use the Order Invoices API, import `{ orderInvoices }` from the `wix-ecom-backend` module:

```javascript
import { orderInvoices } from 'wix-ecom-backend';
```
