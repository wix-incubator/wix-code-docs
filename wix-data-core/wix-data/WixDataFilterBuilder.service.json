        [ "The `WixDataFilter` functions enable you to filter and control which results are returned by a dataset when the\r[`setFilter()`](wix-dataset.Dataset.html#setFilter)  function is applied. \r\rA filter is used to control which data is contained in a dataset on your page.\r\rTypically, you  build a filter using the [`filter()`](wix-data.html#filter) function, refine the filter with `WixDataFilter` functions, and then apply the filter to the dataset using the [`setFilter()`](wix-dataset.Dataset.html#setFilter) function.\r\rFor example, the following code shows a filter on a dataset that is connected to a collection containing customer data. The filter includes only customers over the age of 20:\r\r```javascript\r import wixData from 'wix-data';\r\r const customerFilter = wixData.filter()\r   .gt(\"age\", 20);\r\r $w(\"#myDataset\").setFilter(customerFilter);\r\r\r ```" ],
