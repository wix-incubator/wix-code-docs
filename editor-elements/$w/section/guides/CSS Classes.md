# Section CSS Classes

> **Note:** This feature is only available to Wix Studio users.

You can use the classes listed below
to style your `Section` elements with CSS.

For more information on styling your elements with CSS, see
[Styling Elements with CSS]($w/styling-elements-with-css) and the
[MDN CSS reference docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS).

> **Note:** If the component has Media set up in the Background of the design panel, then CSS properties will not apply to it. To apply CSS properties, first toggle off the Media & pattern switch in the Background section of the design panel.

__Important:__
Element structure and undocumented class names
may change without advance warning.
To avoid unintended style changes to your site,
select elements with the documented class names only.
