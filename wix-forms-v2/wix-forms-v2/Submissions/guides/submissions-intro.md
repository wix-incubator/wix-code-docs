The Form Submissions API allows you to create and manage the submissions made on a form. 

With the Form Submissions API, you can:
- [Query](wix-forms-v2/submissions/querysubmissionsbynamespace) and [manage](wix-forms-v2/submissions/createsubmission) a submission.
- [Retrieve](wix-forms-v2/submissions/countsubmission) the total number of submissions per form.
- [Confirm](wix-forms-v2/submissions/confirmsubmission) a submission or [mark](wix-forms-v2/submissions/bulkmarksubmissionsasseen) submissions as seen. 
- Retrieve a [media upload file](wix-forms-v2/submissions/querysubmissionsbynamespace) url to use in a subission for forms that include a field for uploading files. 


To use the Form Submissions API, import `{ submissions }` from the `wix-forms.v2` module. 

```javascript
import { submissions } from 'wix-forms.v2';
```

## Before you begin

Itâ€™s important to note the following points before starting to code:
- You must first have a form on your site in order to manage form submissions.  


## Terminology

- **Submission:** Data received when a form is submitted by a site visitor. 
- **Media Upload URL:** A URL used to upload a file to a form.
