Velo is always in active development. We are constantly adding new APIs and improving existing ones. We want to make sure that we are on the right track and that we are building the right things. To do that, we need your help. For this reason, we release some APIs in Developer Preview mode. This is a way for us to get feedback from you, our users, before we fully release the APIs.

APIs that are in Developer Preview mode include this warning in the API reference:

Here are some important things you need to know about Developer Preview:

### Breaking changes 
APIs in Developer Preview are still under production. This means that we may **change them at any time**. Notifications about breaking changes appear in the [release notes](/release-notes) and in the [API reference](/api-overview) for the affected functions and properties. We will not contact you directly about breaking changes. 

Because we may introduce breaking changes to these APIs, we don't recommend using them on live sites. They are for testing and feedback purposes only.

### Time limit 
APIs only stay in Developer Preview mode for a maxmimum of 6 months. After that, they are fully released and we don't make any breaking changes to them. You can find the date for a the release of an API in the [release notes](/release-notes).
