Velo is always in active development. We are constantly adding new APIs. We want to make sure that we're on the right track and that we are building the right things. To do that, we need your help. For this reason, we release some of the APIs we're still working on in Developer Preview mode for user testing. This is a way for us to get feedback from you before we fully release them.

APIs in Developer Preview mode include this warning in the API reference:

Here are some important things you need to know about Developer Preview:

### Breaking changes 



APIs in Developer Preview are still under production. This means that we **may change them at any time**. Notifications about breaking changes appear in the [release notes](/release-notes) and in the API reference for the affected functions and properties. We will not contact you directly about breaking changes. 


Because we may introduce breaking changes to these APIs, we don't recommend using them on live sites. They are for testing and feedback purposes only.

### Time limit 
APIs only stay in Developer Preview mode for a maximum of 6 months. After that, they are fully released, and we don't make any breaking changes to them. You can find the dates for the releases of all Developer Preview APIs in the [release notes](/release-notes).
