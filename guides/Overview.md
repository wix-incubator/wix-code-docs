# Introduction

Corvid's APIs empower you to take full control of your site’s functionality. Use the APIs to interact with site elements, your site’s database content, Wix Apps, and external services. The APIs also give you access to information about your site, its users, and more.

To use the APIs, you’ll need a working knowledge of JavaScript, including ES2017 features. The APIs include lots of code examples to help you [get started](tutorials/getting-started).
