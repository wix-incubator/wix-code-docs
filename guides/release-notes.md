### New API: onAudioTranscoded

`wix-media-backend`

In addition to video files, audio files that are imported or uploaded to the Media Manager require transcoding, and are not immediately available until the transcoding has completed.

Now you can create, update, hide, and archive pricing plans. You can set and clear which pricing plan is the primary plan and rearrange the order in which plans are displayed on the site.

### Updated: cancelOrder throws an error

`wix-paid-plans`

We clarified that [`cancelOrder`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-paid-plans/cancelorder) throws an error when **[Allow Plan Cancellation](https://support.wix.com/en/article/pricing-plans-allowing-clients-to-cancel-plans)** is set to False in the Dashboard. (February 3, 2021)

`Wix Editor Elements ($w)`

Setting the [`options`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/$w/selectiontags/options) property no longer clears the `value` and `selectedIndices` of the selection tags. This allows users to add and reorder choices without clearing the visitor's selection. Only values that no longer match the new options are cleared.

Setting `value` no longer lets you set values that do not match any of the options. (February 3, 2021)

### Updated: formattedPrice and formattedDiscountedPrice are read-only

`wix-stores-backend`

We removed a reference to `formattedPrice` and `formattedDiscountedPrice` fields for [`updateVariantData()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-stores-backend/updatevariantdata) since they are read-only and can't be set. (February 3, 2021)

### Updated: Wix Data is eventually consistent

`wix-data`

The wix-data API is [eventually consistent](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data/introduction#wix-data_introduction_wix-data-and-eventual-consistency), meaning that sometimes updates to your database collection are not immediate. There may be a short delay until the system is up-to-date with your recent changes. During the delay, the data you get back may not reflect those changes. (December 27, 2020)

### API Updated: Added seoData field to the Product object

We added the `seoData` field to the Product object. This mirrors the SEO data added in the dashboard and allows for adding custom SEO tags when using [`createProduct()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-stores-backend/createproduct). (December 27, 2020)

We also reviewed the existing explanations and made some updates, including:

Video boxes allow you to showcase your videos in beautifully-designed video containers. Unlike VideoPlayer elements, VideoBox elements do not have controls, text descriptions, titles and cannot be displayed in full screen mode. This gives video boxes a clean look.
You can use the APIs to manage video boxes for: 

- Videos uploaded to your site

### Updated: wixLocation URL structure

`wix-location`

The layout for describing the different parts of the [`URL`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-location/introduction) was a bit confusing.
