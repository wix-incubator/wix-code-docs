# Onboarding to Corvid by Wix
## The Basics
Welcome to Corvid by Wix! Below you’ll find a list of resources we’ve put together to help you onboard and get started creating advanced web applications with Corvid. We know people learn in different ways, so we’ve put together a mix of videos, articles, and tutorials for you. For each resource, we also let you know approximately how long it will take to complete, and give you an overview of what you’ll learn. If you like seeing the whole picture and then backing up to learn the details, feel free to look at the [more comprehensive material](#next-steps) first.

### Coding in Corvid
#### Introducing Corvid by Wix (video 1:17)
A [quick introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeDD5CpS_wk) to the capabilities that Corvid adds to Wix sites. This gives you a taste of what you can do without getting into implementation details. After watching this video, you can decide what you want to learn about next.

#### Corvid by Wix (article ~5 min)
Similar to the video above, [this article](https://support.wix.com/en/article/about-corvid-by-wix) gives you a high-level introduction to all of Corvid’s capabilities. You get some more technical details here, plus links to all of our learning resources.

#### "Hello World": Adding Custom Interactivity to Your Site (video 6:27 with accompanying article)
Corvid’s APIs let you control your Wix site in ways you couldn’t before. [This tutorial and video](https://support.wix.com/en/article/corvid-tutorial-adding-custom-interactivity-with-events) shows you how to add logic to your site so that it responds in specific ways to different user actions. This tutorial is also code-focused and works with:
 - [The Properties panel](#working-with-the-properties-panel-article-3-min) 
 - [The Code panel](#working-in-the-code-panel-article-10-min)
 - [The Site Structure sidebar](#working-with-the-site-structure-sidebar-article-6-min) 
 -   [Event handlers](https://support.wix.com/en/article/corvid-reacting-to-user-actions-using-events)

### Working with Databases
#### About Wix Data (article ~5 min)
Wix Data adds database capabilities to Wix sites. When data is combined with Corvid, you’re able to customize your site and create a truly unique user experience that meets your and your visitors’ needs. [This article](https://support.wix.com/en/article/about-wix-data) introduces you to creating collections, connecting them to the elements in your site, and creating dynamic pages.

#### How to Set up a Database Collection (video 2:25)
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcL72uzy1ZU&list=PL0y_aclKYoYhzHA9TbgEhzU68bvRI15mI&index=18&t=0s) walks you through the process of creating and setting up a database collection. It explains the different options you have to organize your data, and introduces you to our permissions model, which lets you control who has access to your data.

#### How to Collect & Display User-Generated Content on Your Website (video 4:01)
You really feel the power of Corvid when you combine all of its various capabilities to get the most out of your site. In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVARVy3YS74&feature=youtu.be), we build a travel site that lets visitors add and view user reviews. It includes the following features:
- [Wix Data](https://support.wix.com/en/article/about-wix-data)
- [User Input elements](https://support.wix.com/en/article/about-user-input-elements)
- [Datasets](https://support.wix.com/en/article/about-datasets-6368396) (connecting your site elements to data)
- [Repeaters](https://support.wix.com/en/article/about-repeaters) (display unlimited content from a collection on a single page)
- [The Properties panel](#working-with-the-properties-panel-article-3-min) 
- [Code](https://support.wix.com/en/corvid-by-wix/coding-with-corvid)

If you like diving into the deep end when you learn, this video is for you.

## Next Steps
### Corvid API Overview (article ~7 min)
Corvid’s APIs empower you to take full control of your site’s functionality. You use the APIs to interact with page elements, your site’s database content, and external services. The APIs also give you access to information about your site, its users, and more. [This article](https://support.wix.com/en/article/corvid-api-overview) gives you a high-level introduction to all of Corvid’s APIs and what they enable you to do.

### Advanced Coding "Hello World" (article ~45 min to 2 hrs. depending on code proficiency)
The beauty of Corvid is that it lets you get “under the hood” and add your own custom JavaScript to your site. This is how Corvid really unlocks the power of Wix. In [this tutorial](https://support.wix.com/en/article/getting-started-with-corvid-by-wix), we walk you through our version of “Hello World,” where we build a currency converter. This tutorial is very code-focused and introduces you to:

- [The Properties panel](#working-with-the-properties-panel-article-3-min) 
- [The Code panel](#working-in-the-code-panel-article-10-min)
- [The $w.onReady function](https://support.wix.com/en/article/corvid-working-in-the-code-panel#making-sure-the-element-has-loaded-before-you-reference-it) (running code when your page loads)
- Code that customizes dropdowns
- The [getJSON() function](https://www.wix.com/corvid/reference/wix-fetch.html#getJSON), which retrieves a JSON resource from the network

If you want to cut your teeth on the full development capabilities of Corvid, this is the place to start.

### Working in the Code Panel (article ~10 min)
The Code panel is where all the coding action happens in Corvid, and it will help if you fully understand its capabilities. [This article](https://support.wix.com/en/article/corvid-working-in-the-code-panel) introduces you to:

- The Page and Site tabs
- Corvid syntax and autocomplete
- How to make sure an element has loaded before you reference it
- Working with your elements
- Warnings and errors
- Media Manager integration
- Testing your code
- Saving versions of your code

### How to Create a Dynamic Item Page and Index Page (video 7:55)
[Dynamic pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWdlWie1iKk&list=PL0y_aclKYoYhzHA9TbgEhzU68bvRI15mI&index=20&t=0s) let you use one page layout to create as many pages as you need, each with a custom URL and unique content. Imagine a recipe site that displays each recipe in an identical layout but on its own page. With Dynamic Pages you create one layout and connect that page to your database collection. Then your site makes as many pages as your data defines. If your site has a lot of similar content like this, Dynamic Pages are a must.
