# Querying Velo APIs

The following query techniques are used in Velo. 

Check the Velo Reference to see which technique is supported for querying a specific API. 
    
* [With query builders](#with-query-builders): You call query functions that build a query to retrieve a list of items. You can recognize these query functions because they have associated `<item>QueryBuilder` and `<item>QueryResult` class objects. This is the standard Velo querying technique.
    
* [With the API Query Language](#without-query-builders): Some query functions retrieve a list of items using the API Query Language instead of with query builders. For these queries, pass an object defining the query to the query function.


## With query builders

For querying with query builders, call the query functions dedicated to a specific API that build the query. Each query function supports different sets of operators and paging options. For example, the Pricing Plans [`queryPublicPlans()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-pricing-plans-v2/plans/querypublicplans) function:
+ Processes the query specified with the [`PlansQueryBuilder`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-pricing-plans-v2/plans/plansquerybuilder/ascending) operators.
+ Presents the results using the [`PlansQueryResult`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-pricing-plans-v2/plans/plansqueryresult/currentpage) specifications. 

Alternatively, you can call the more generic yet robust Wix Data API to query any collection. The Wix Data API offers additional query functionality like aggregation and querying referenced items. Call the [`query()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data/query) function with: 
+ [`DataItemsQueryBuilder`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data/wixdataquery) operators
+ [`DataItemsQueryResult`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data/wixdataqueryresult) specifications



## With the API Query Language

For querying without query builders, pass an object defining the query to the query function. Define the object with the API Query Language.

### Query object syntax

You can pass some or all of the following properties to the query function to define the query:

* [`filter`](#the-filter-object):
  Which results to return.
* [`sort`](#the-sort-array):
  In what order.
* [`paging`](#the-paging-object):
  Return only some of the matched entities.
* [`fields`](#the-fields-array):
  Field projection. Returns only part of each entity.
* [`fieldsets`](#the-fieldsets-array):
  Predefined, named sets of fields for common use cases.
  This is a shorthand provided by individual APIs.

Usually these query properties are contained in a `query` object. 

+ In some cases, the `query` object might be wrapped inside an `options` object.
+ In other cases, the query's properties might be defined directly inside an `options` object (without being wrapped in a `query` object). 

See your specific API for information on how to define the object you need to pass to the query function. 


Specifying an empty object as a parameter to a query function returns all items according to the API's default paging and sort order.


### The filter object

The `filter` is a single object `{ }` with the following syntax for specifying operators:

#### Equality

The format `{ "<field>": <value> }` specifies an equality condition.

For example, `{ "status": "DONE" }`
matches all entities where `status` is `"DONE"`.

#### Operators

Operators use the format `{ "<field>": { "$<operator>": <value> } }`.

For example, `{ "status": { "$in": ["PENDING", "DONE"] } }`
matches all entities where status is `"PENDING"` or `"DONE"`.

The operators specified below are supported. See the specific API for information on supported filter options for the query function you are using. 

##### Comparison operators

* `$eq`: Matches values that are equal to a specified value.
* `$ne`: Matches all values that are not equal to a specified value.
* `$gt`: Matches values that are greater than a specified value.
* `$gte`: Matches values that are greater than or equal to a specified value.
* `$lt`: Matches values that are less than a specified value.
* `$lte`: Matches values that are less than or equal to a specified value.
* `$in`: Matches any of the values specified in an array.
* `$nin`: Matches none of the values specified in an array.
* `$startsWith`: Matches strings that start with a specified value. Not case-sensitive.
* `$isEmpty`: Matches strings or arrays that are empty or not empty,
  depending on whether the specified operand is `true` or `false`.

##### Logical operators

* `$and`: Joins query clauses with a logical _AND_
  and returns all items that match the conditions of both clauses.
* `$or`: Joins query clauses with a logical _OR_
  and returns all items that match the conditions of either clause.
* `$not`: Inverts the effect of a query expression
  and returns items that don't match the query expression.

##### Element operators

* `$exists`: Matches items where the specified field exists and has a non-null value.


##### Array operators

* `$hasAll`: Matches arrays that contain all elements specified in the query.
* `$hasSome`: Matches arrays that contain at least one element specified in the query.

#### Sample queries

In the following example, the compound query returns all entities where the status equals `"A"` and either `qty` is less than `30` or `item` starts with the character `p`:

```json
{
  "status": "A",
  "$or": [
    {
      "qty": { "$lt": 30 }
    },
    {
      "item": { "$startsWith": "p" }
    }
  ]
}
```

The following example queries entities where the field `tags` value is an array with exactly two elements, `"red"` and `"blank"`, in the specified order:

```json
{
  "tags": [ "red", "blank" ]
}
```

The following example queries for all entities where `tags` is an array that contains the string `"red"` as one of its elements, or that `tags` is the string `"red"`:

```json
{
  "tags": "red"
}
```

The following query matches entities that do not contain the `item` field, or where the `item` field has no value:

```json
{
  "item": { "$exists": false }
}
```

### The sort array

`sort` is an array of field names and sort order.
If `order` is not specified for a field, the field is sorted in ascending order.
Sorting is applied to the first `sort` item, then the second, and so on:

```json
{
  "sort": [
    {
      "fieldName": "sortField1"
    },
    {
      "fieldName": "sortField2",
      "order": "DESC"
    }
  ]
}
```

### The paging object

The `paging` object describes the size of the data set to return per response
and how many records to skip.
Each API can support **offset paging**, **cursor paging**, or both.
See your specific API for information on supported paging options.

#### Offset paging

With offset paging, you provide a `limit` and `offset` with each request.
To retrieve additional pages,
submit subsequent requests with an increased `offset`
equal to the previous page's `limit` plus `offset`.

For example, this offset request returns records 41 through 60:

```json
{
  "paging": {
    "limit": 20,
    "offset": 40
  }
}
```

#### Cursor paging

With cursor paging, each request returns a `cursors` object
that contains cursor strings that point to the next page, previous page, or both.
To retrieve either page, use the returned `next` or `prev` cursor
in the next request's `cursor` parameter.

Take this response object, for example:

```json
{
  "pagingMetadata": {
    "count": 10,
    "offset": 0,
    "cursors": {
      "next": "eyJmaWx0ZXIiOnsiJGFuZCI6W3sibGFuZ3VhZ2UiOnsiJGluIjpbImVuIiwiaGUiXX19LHsic3RhdHVzIjoicHVibGlzaGVkIn1dfSwidmFsdWUiOnsiaXNQaW5uZWQiOmZhbHNlLCJmaXJzdFB1Ymxpc2hlZERhdGUiOiIyMDIyLTA2LTAyVDA2OjQ2OjAyLjgwMloifSwib3JkZXIiOnsiaXNQaW5uZWQiOi0xLCJmaXJzdFB1Ymxpc2hlZERhdGUiOi0xLCJpZCI6LTF9fQ=="
    }
  }
}
```

You can use the returned `next` cursor to retrieve the next page of results
by forming your request like this:

```json
{
  "query": {
    "cursorPaging": {
      "cursor": "eyJmaWx0ZXIiOnsiJGFuZCI6W3sibGFuZ3VhZ2UiOnsiJGluIjpbImVuIiwiaGUiXX19LHsic3RhdHVzIjoicHVibGlzaGVkIn1dfSwidmFsdWUiOnsiaXNQaW5uZWQiOmZhbHNlLCJmaXJzdFB1Ymxpc2hlZERhdGUiOiIyMDIyLTA2LTAyVDA2OjQ2OjAyLjgwM1oifSwib3JkZXIiOnsiaXNQaW5uZWQiOi0xLCJmaXJzdFB1Ymxpc2hlZERhdGUiOi0xLCJpZCI6LTF9fQ"
    }
  }
}
```

## The fields array

`fields` is an array of field paths to return.

If a field path points to an object, the entire sub-object is returned.
Subsets of sub-objects can be returned by using dot notation.
In this example,
the returned entities contain `firstName` from the `name` sub-object
and the entire `address` object:

```json
{
  "fields": [
    "name.firstName",
    "address"
  ]
}
```

### The fieldsets array

An API may provide named projections to save clients from specifying individual fields in common cases.

For example,
the Contacts API implements a fieldset named `BASIC` that contains only
`id`, `revision`, `info.name.first`, `info.name.last`,
`primaryInfo.email`, and `primaryInfo.phone`.

To use a fieldset, specify its name in the `fieldsets` array.

If both `fieldsets` and `fields` arrays exist, the union of both is returned.
For example:

```json
{
  "fieldsets": [
    "BASIC"
  ]
}
```
