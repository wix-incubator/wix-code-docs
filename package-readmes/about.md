# Velo Packages

Built using the Velo APIs, Velo packages are created specifically for Wix websites and work seamlessly with Wix elements and apps. You can view the code used to implement the package, and each package contains a detailed readme file explaining the package's functionality and the steps required for implementation.

A Velo package can include backend code files, public code files, and npm packages. A Velo package's functionality is available for use through its exported functions. You can import the functions and use them in your code. If you have an idea for a Velo package that is not yet in our registry, you can request it in the Velo Wishlist.
