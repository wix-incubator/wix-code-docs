A data hook allows you to intercept the interaction immediately before or immediately after it occurs.\n\nFor example, you may want to intercept an item before it is added to your collection to perform a final validation or tweak the data that actually makes it into the collection." },
      { "title": "How do I add a hook to a collection?",
        "markdown": "In the [Data Manager](https://support.wix.com/en/article/accessing-your-sandbox-and-live-data), click the **Hooks** button and choose which hooks to add. Code for the hooks is written in the **data.js** file which resides in **Backend** section of your site. Hook functions are defined using the following pattern:\n\n`export function <collectionName>_<hookName>(<parameters>) { }`\n\n[Learn more](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-code-using-data-hooks)." },
