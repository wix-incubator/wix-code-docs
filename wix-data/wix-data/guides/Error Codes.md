|---------------------------------------|---------|-----------------|
|WDE0001| Collection name must be a string.| Check that the collection name you provided is a valid string.
|WDE0002| Item ID must be a string.| Check that the item `_id` you provided is a valid string.
|WDE0003| Field name must be a string.| Check that the field name you provided is a valid string.
|WDE0004| Failed to save {your item name} into {your collection name}. Items must be JavaScript objects.| Check that the item you're saving is a valid JavaScript object.
|WDE0005| Failed to bulk save items into {your collection name}. Items must be an array of JavaScript objects and item IDs must be strings if present.| One or more of the items you tried to save was invalid. Make sure that the items are an array of valid JavaScript objects and that any `_id` properties in the items are strings. A valid ID key-value pair looks like this:<br>`'_id': 'ffdkj9c2-df8g-f9ke-lk98-4kjhfr89keedb'`
|WDE0006| Failed to bulk save items into {your collection name}.Cannot insert more than 1000 items in one request.| You tried to save too many items at once. Avoid this error by splitting up your request into batches of fewer than 1000 items.
|WDE0007|Invalid update. Updated object must have an _id property that is a string.| Check that the object you passed for the `item` parameter has a property called `_id` that's a valid string.|
|WDE0008|wixData.{the function you called} expects between {minimum} and {maximum} arguments, but was called with {the number of arguments you provided}.| The wrong number of arguments were passed to the function. Check your code to make sure that you are passing a valid number of arguments, and that you separate the argument values with commas.|
|WDE0009| Document is too large.|The maximum size for a single collection item is 512 KB. Make sure the items you're adding are smaller than this.|
|WDE0011| Invalid .filter usage. .filter requires WixDataFilter.| Check that the argument passed to the WixDataAggregate [`filter()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data/wixdataaggregate/filter) function is a valid [WixDataFilter](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data/wixdatafilter) object.
|WDE0012| Invalid {function you called} usage. Filter is already set.| You are trying to use this function to set a filter, but you've already set one. Check your code to see where the previous filter was set.
|WDE0013| Invalid .group usage. Group is already set.| You are trying to use the [`group()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data/wixdataaggregate/group) function to set a group for your aggregation, but you've already set one. Check your code to see where the previous group was set.
|WDE0014| Requests per minute quota exceeded.| Your site has exceeded the quota of the maximum number of data requests per minute. [Learn more](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-about-data-quotas#overall-processing-time) about this quota and how to prevent this error.
|WDE0016| Filter must be an object.| Check that your filter is a valid JavaScript object. [Learn more](http://wix.to/iEAFATM).
|WDE0018| Options must be an object with one or all of the following boolean properties:...|Check that the options object you provided for a function is invalid.<br><br>For example, the [`save()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data/save) function accepts 2 keys in it's `options` parameter, `supressAuth`, and `supressHooks`. Defining an options object where either of those keys doesn't have a boolean value results in an error.<br><br>To find the appropriate options parameters for the function you're using, consult the API Reference.
|WDE0019| Reference operation takes a string ID or an object with an ID to be connected.|Check that the parameter passed to this function is either a string or an object with an `_id` field.
|WDE0020| Provided relationship attribute {your field name} is not a multi-reference field.| You tried to add a multi-reference value to a field that isn't multi-reference type. [Learn more](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data/introduction).
|WDE0021| Invalid reference| Check that the referring and referenced items you provided are valid. A valid referring item is either an `_id` string or an object with an `_id` property. A valid referenced item is either an `_id` string, an object with an `_id` property, or an array of `_id` strings.
|WDE0022| Unable to execute a query. Only single multi-reference field can be included.| Your query includes more than the maximum of one multi-reference field. [Learn more](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data/wixdataquery/include).
|WDE0023| Cannot fetch more than 50 elements when include is being used on multi-reference field| Your query reached the limit of 50 referenced items. To retrieve more than 50 referenced items, use the [queryReferenced()](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data/queryreferenced) function. Learn more about [Querying Items that Reference Other Items](https://support.wix.com/en/article/including-referenced-data-when-filtering).
|WDE0024| Field is deleted| The field you're trying to access was deleted. [Restore the field](https://support.wix.com/en/article/restoring-a-deleted-field-in-a-collection) in the Content Manager before using it in your code.
|WDE0025| The {your collection name} collection does not exist. You cannot work with a collection using the Data API before it is created in the Editor.| Check that the collection you're trying to access exists on your site.|
|WDE0026| The {your collection name} collection was removed, so you cannot work with it. To restore its data, create a new collection with the same name.| You're trying to access a deleted collection in your code. Restore the collection by creating a new collection with the same name.|
|WDE0027| The current user does not have permissions to {some action} on the {your collection name} collection.| A data request was made with insufficient permissions. You can [change the permissions for a collection](https://support.wix.com/en/article/changing-your-collection-permissions) in the Editor.
|WDE0028| Operation time limit exceeded.| Your data request ran for more than 5 seconds and [timed out](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-about-data-quotas#individual-request-timeout). The request was terminated. If this error persists, it may be because your request is working with large amounts of data. Consider [indexing your collections](https://support.wix.com/en/article/content-manager-adding-an-index-for-your-collection) to improve performance and avoid this error. 
|WDE0037| Invalid query on {your collection name}, invalid prev positioned query skip on a negative number.| Check that the skip value you provided for the query isn't less than 0. 
|WDE0044| Invalid {function name} parameter value. {function name} parameter must be a String.| Check that the parameter indicated in the error message is a string.|
|WDE0052| The current site is in template mode. Please save it to modify data.| To modify collection data on a site created from a template, make sure to [save the site](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-save-preview-and-publish-your-site#saving-your-site) first.
|WDE0053| Internal wixData error:| An unexpected error occurred. Please [contact support](https://www.wix.com/contact).
|WDE0068| Item IDs must be an array of strings| Check that the [`bulkRemove()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data/bulkremove) function received an array of strings representing the IDs of the items you want to remove as its second argument.<br><br>Here is an example of a valid array: `['ffdkj9c2-df8g-f9ke-lk98-4kjhfr89keedb', 'afthj8s4-dt7u-g4fr-at23-6joedh34awshy']`
|WDE0069| Failed to remove items from {your collection name}. Cannot remove more than 1000 items in one request| You tried to remove too many items from a collection at once. Avoid this error by splitting up your request into batches of fewer than 1000 items. To remove all the items in a collection, use [`truncate()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data/truncate).
|WDE0073| Item {requested item's ID} does not exist in collection {your collection name}.| Make sure that an item with the ID you're requesting exists in the collection you're querying.
|WDE0074| WD_ITEM_ALREADY_EXISTS| An item with the requested ID value already exists. This error occurs when you try to insert an item into a collection with an `_id` value that already exists in that collection. If you are trying to either insert a new item or update it if it already exists, use [`save()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data/save).
|WDE0075| WD_BAD_REQUEST||
|WDE0076| WD_VALIDATION_ERROR|A [Wix App Collection](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-working-with-wix-app-collections-and-code) or an [external database](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-integrating-external-databases-with-your-wix-site) that you're working with made an invalid data request. Check your code to make sure that your data requests are valid.
|WDE0078| Hook error.| The code for one of your [data hook](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-about-data-hooks) functions threw an error.<br><br>For example, consider an `afterInsert` data hook function in a `backend/data.js` file that includes this line of code: `throw new Error("sample error message")`<br><br>Once you define this hook, calling the [`insert()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data/insert) function results in the `WDE0078` error. 
|WDE0079| {your collection name} is a single item collection and item must have id {expected ID}, but got {received ID} instead.| The item in a single item collection has a fixed `_id` value. Check that your aren't attempting to change this value in your code. You can find the item's `_id` value using the [Content Manager](https://support.wix.com/en/article/about-the-content-manager-7160473#collections) or by using ['find()'](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data/wixdataquery/find) without any filters.
|WDE0091| Database quota exceeded. Delete some data and try again.| Your site has exceeded the collection storage quota. [Learn more](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-about-data-quotas#collection-storage) about what you can do to resolve this issue.
|WDE0092| Dataset is too large to sort.| The dataset you tried to sort didn't fit into memory. This usually occurs when large items are being sorted or the collection has too many items to fit into memory at once. [Add an index](https://support.wix.com/en/article/content-manager-adding-an-index-for-your-collection) to your collection to avoid using up memory.
|WDE0093| Invalid filter for _publishStatus field, only .eq and .ne filters are allowed with 'DRAFT' and 'PUBLISHED' possible values.| When you enable the [Draft and Publish Items](https://support.wix.com/en/article/content-manager-using-the-draft-publish-items-feature) feature for a collection, a `_publishStatus` field is added to every item in that collection. If you want to filter a data request based on this field, you can only use the [`eq()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data/wixdatafilter/eq) and [`ne()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data/wixdatafilter/ne) functions. The only valid values for `_publishedStatus` are `DRAFT` and `PUBLISHED`. Check that your code isn't using other filter functions or values with `_publishedStatus`.
|WDE0115| WD_UNKNOWN_ERROR| Your external database requested an unsupported data operation.
|WDE0116| WD_UNKNOWN_ERROR| Your external database responded to Wix with an error.
|WDE0121| Sorting by multiple array fields is not supported| If there are multiple fields in your collection that contain arrays, you can't sort by both of them at once.<br><br>For example, consider a collection item that includes a field called `A` whose value is `[1,2,3]` and a field called `B` whose value is `[3,2,1]`. In this case, attempting to sort by both `A` and `B` at once results in an error. If your collection contains multiple fields that are arrays, check that you aren't trying to sort using more than one at once.
|WDE0122| Processing time quota exceeded.| Wix limits the number of read and write requests you can make from your site per minute. The maximum number for read requests is 3000 and the maximum for write requests is 1500. We can increase these quotas in certain cases. [Learn More](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-about-data-quotas#overall-processing-time) about this quota and what you can do to resolve this issue.
