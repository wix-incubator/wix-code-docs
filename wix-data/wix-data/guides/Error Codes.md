|<span id="WDE0091">WDE0091</span>| Database quota exceeded. Delete some data and try again.| Your site has exceeded the collection storage quota. Learn more about [this quota](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-about-data-quotas#collection-storage) and what you can do to resolve this issue. |
|<span id="WDE0092">WDE0092</span>| Dataset is too large to sort.| The data you tried to sort didn't fit into memory. This usually occurs when large items are being sorted or there are too many items being sorted to fit into memory at once. [Add an index](https://support.wix.com/en/article/content-manager-adding-an-index-for-your-collection) to your collection to avoid using up memory. |
|<span id="WDE0093">WDE0093</span>| Invalid filter for _publishStatus field, only `.eq` and `.ne` filters are allowed with 'DRAFT' and 'PUBLISHED' possible values.| When you enable the [Draft and Publish Items](https://support.wix.com/en/article/content-manager-using-the-draft-publish-items-feature) feature for a collection, a `_publishStatus` field is added to every item in that collection. If you want to filter a data request based on this field, you can only use the [`eq()`](https://dev.wix.com/docs/velo/api-reference/wix-data/wix-data-filter/eq) and [`ne()`](https://dev.wix.com/docs/velo/api-reference/wix-data/wix-data-filter/ne) functions. The only valid values for `_publishedStatus` are `'DRAFT'` and `'PUBLISHED'`. Check that your code isn't using other filter functions or values with `_publishedStatus`. |
|<span id="WDE0094">WDE0094</span>| Invalid {operator} parameter. {operator} parameter must be non-empty string. | The argument passed to this function must be a non-empty string. |

|<span id="WDE0120">WDE0120</span>| {your collection name} does not support {function name} operation. | Some specialized collections, like the ones that hold data for Wix apps, don't support the full data API. This error occurs when you try to call a function that isn't supported by a specific collection. Remove the unsupported function call from your code. |
|<span id="WDE0121">WDE0121</span>| Sorting by multiple array fields is not supported| If there are multiple fields in your collection that contain arrays, you can't sort by both of them at once. <br><br>For example, consider a collection item that includes a field called `A` whose value is `[1,2,3]` and a field called `B` whose value is `[3,2,1]`. In this case, attempting to sort by both `A` and `B` at once results in an error. If your collection contains multiple fields that are arrays, check that you aren't trying to sort using more than one at once. |
|<span id="WDE0123">WDE0123</span>| Duplicated values cannot be added to a field with a unique index.| When you add a [unique index](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-indexes-and-wix-data-collections#working-with-unique-indexes) to a collection, each value for the indexed field in that collection must be unique. This error occurs when you try to add a duplicate value for the field. To resolve the error, use a unique value. |
|<span id="WDE0128">WDE0128</span> | WD_UNKNOWN_ERROR | Your [external database adaptor](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-integrating-external-databases-with-your-wix-site) tried to create a collection item with no `_id` field. Check that any item created by an external adaptor contains this field. |
|<span id="WDE0133">WDE0133</span> | Document field is too large to index, exceeds 1024 bytes. | This error occurs when you try to add a value to an indexed field that, together with other indexed fields, becomes too large. The total size of all indexed field values per item must be 1024 bytes or less. Learn more about [working with indexes](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-indexes-and-wix-data-collections) in your collections. |
| <span id="WDE0134">WDE0134</span> | Field names with dollar ($) prefix are not allowed. | This error occurs when you try to add a field to a collection with a `$` at the beginning of its name. To resolve this error, remove the `$` from the name. |
| <span id="WDE0144">WDE0144</span> | Issue with processing data. | You don't have permission to perform this action. Ask the collection administrator for the required permissions. |
| <span id="WDE0149">WDE0149</span> | Internal application error. | This error occurs when a Wix app collection fails with a system or unrecognized error. To resolve the error, retry the request. If the request fails, [contact support](https://www.wix.com/contact). |
