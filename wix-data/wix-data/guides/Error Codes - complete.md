|WDE0007|Invalid update. Updated object must have an _id property that is a string.||
|WDE0008|wixData.{the function you called} expects between {minimum} and {maximum} arguments, but was called with {the number of arguments you provided}.| Check your code to make sure that the you have passed enough arguments to the function, and that the arugment values are separated with commas.|
|WDE0009| Document is too large.|The maximum size for a single collection item is 512 KB. Make sure the items you're adding are smaller than this.|
|WDE0011| Invalid .filter usage. .filter requires WixDataFilter.| The argument passed to the WixDataAggregate [`filter()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data/wixdataaggregate/filter) function must be a valid [WixDataFilter](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data/wixdatafilter) object.
|WDE0012| Invalid {function you called} usage. Filter is already set.| You are trying to use this function to set a filter, but you've already set one. Check your code to see where the previous filter was set.

Defining an options object where either of those keys don't have boolean values results in an error.<br><br>To find the appropriate options parameters for the function you're using, consult the API Reference.
|WDE0019| Reference operation takes a string ID or an object with an ID to be connected.|The parameter provided to this function must either be a string or an object with _id field.
|WDE0020| Provided relationship attribute {your field name} is not a multi-reference field.| This error is thrown when you try to add a multi-reference value to a field that isn't multi-reference type. [Learn more](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data/introduction)
|WDE0021| Invalid reference| Either the referring or referenced item you provided isn't valid. A valid referring item is either an `_id` string or an object with and `_id` property.

|WDE0028| Operation time limit exceeded.| Your data request ran for more than 5 seconds and [timed out](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-about-data-quotas#individual-request-timeout). The request was terminated. If this error persists, it may be because your request is working with large amounts of data. Consider [indexing your collections](https://support.wix.com/en/article/content-manager-adding-an-index-for-your-collection) to improve data request performance. 
|WDE0037| Invalid query on {your collection name}, invalid prev positioned query skip on a negative number.| The skip value you provide for a query can't be less than 0.

|WDE0069| Failed to remove items from {your collection name}. Cannot remove more than 1000 items in one request| Avoid this error by splitting up your request into batches of fewer than 1000 items. To remove all the items in a collection, use [`truncate()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data/truncate).
|WDE0073| Item {requested item's ID} does not exist in collection {your collection name}.||
|WDE0074| WD_ITEM_ALREADY_EXISTS| An item with the requested ID value already exists. This error occurs when you try to insert an item into a collection with an `_id` value that already exists in that collection. If you are trying to either insert a new item or update it if it already exists, use [`save()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data/save).
|WDE0075| WD_BAD_REQUEST||
|WDE0076| WD_VALIDATION_ERROR|This error is thrown when you make invalid wix-data requests while working with a [Wix App Collection](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-working-with-wix-app-collections-and-code) or an [external database](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-integrating-external-databases-with-your-wix-site).
|WDE0078| Hook error.| This error occurs when you throw an error in the code for a [data hook](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-about-data-hooks) function.<br><br>For example, consider a data hook function in a `backend/data.js` file that includes this line of code: `throw new Error("sample error message")`<br><br>Once this hook is defined, calling the [`insert()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data/insert) function results in the `WDE0078` error. 
|WDE0079| {your collection name} is a single item collection and item must have id {expected ID}, but got {received ID} instead.| The item in a single item collection has a fixed `_id` value. Attempting to change this value produces this error. You can find the item's `_id` using the [Content Manager](https://support.wix.com/en/article/about-the-content-manager-7160473#collections) or by using ['find()'](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data/wixdataquery/find) without any filters.
|WDE0091| Database quota exceeded. Delete some data and try again.| Your site has exceeded the collection storage quota. [Learn more](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-about-data-quotas#collection-storage) about what you can do to resolve this issue.
|WDE0092| Dataset is too large to sort.| The dataset you tried to sort didn't fit into memory. This usually occurs when large items are being sorted or the collection has too many items to fit into memory at once. [Add an index](https://support.wix.com/en/article/content-manager-adding-an-index-for-your-collection) to your collection to avoid using up memory.
|WDE0093| Invalid filter for _publishStatus field, only .eq and .ne filters are allowed with 'DRAFT' and 'PUBLISHED' possible values.| When you enable the [Draft and Publish Items](https://support.wix.com/en/article/content-manager-using-the-draft-publish-items-feature) feature for a collection, a `_publishStatus` field is added to every item in that collection. If you want to filter a data request based on this field, you can only use the [`eq()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data/wixdatafilter/eq) and [`ne()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data/wixdatafilter/ne) functions. The only valid values for `_publishedStatus` are `DRAFT` and `PUBLISHED`. Using other filter functions or values with `_publishedStatus` results in this error.
|WDE0115| WD_UNKNOWN_ERROR| Your external database requested an unsupported data operation.
|WDE0116| WD_UNKNOWN_ERROR| This error occurs when your external database responds to Wix with an error.
|WDE0121| Sorting by multiple array fields is not supported| If there are multiple fields in your collection that contain arrays, you can't sort by both of them at once.<br><br>For example, consider a collection item that includes a field called `A` whose value is `[1,2,3]` and a field called `B` whose value is `[3,2,1]`. In this case, attempting to sort by both `A` and `B` at once results in an error.
|WDE0122| Processing time quota exceeded.| Wix limits the number of read and write requests you can make from your site per minute. The maximum number for read requests is 3000 and the maximum for write requests is 1500. We can increase these quotas in certain cases. [Learn More](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-about-data-quotas#overall-processing-time) about this quota and what you can do to resolve this issue.
