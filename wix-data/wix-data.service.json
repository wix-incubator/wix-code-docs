      { "title": "How do I populate a repeater with data from a query?",
        "markdown": "The most common way to populate a repeater is as follows:\n\n1. Set the repeater's data using the [`data`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/$w.Repeater.html#data) property. This triggers the second step for all items in the data array with a new ID.\n2. Populate the repeater with data from the new items using the [`onItemReady()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/$w.Repeater.html#onItemReady) function.\n\nFor data from a query, set the repeater's [`data`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/$w.Repeater.html#data) property to the [`items`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data.WixDataQueryResult.html#items) property of the query's [`results`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data.WixDataQueryResult.html).

      { "title": "How do I update some fields for a collection item without deleting the values in the items other fields?",
        "markdown": "When you call the [`update()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data.html#update) function, all fields of the corresponding item in your collection are updated. That means, if you pass an item to [`update()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data.html#update) and it does not contain all the fields in your collection, the fields that do not appear will have their values deleted. \n\nTo only update some values:\n\n1. Call the [`get()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data.html#get) or [`query()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data.html#query) function to retrieve the item's current values. \n2. Change the values in the returned item.\n3. Call the [`update()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data.html#update) function and pass it the item with the changed values.\n\nSee the **Get an item in a collection and update it** and **Query an item in a collection and update it** examples found [here](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data.html#update)." },

Add the [`limit()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data.WixDataQuery.html#limit) function to your query chain to change the limit on the number of items returned by a query." },
      { "title": "How do I retrieve the items referenced by another item?",
        "markdown": "When you [query an item that references other items](https://support.wix.com/en/article/including-referenced-data-when-filtering), you only receive the IDs of the referenced items in the query's results.\n\nThere are two ways to retrieve the items referenced by another item:\n\n1. Call the [`queryReferenced()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data.html#queryReferenced) function to retrieve the items referenced in the specified property of an item.\n2. Add the [`include()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data.WixDataQuery.html#include) function to your query chain to included referenced items for the specified properties in your query's results." },
      { "title": "Why is my data operation working in preview, but not in my published site?",
        "markdown": "This may be caused by a [permissions](https://support.wix.com/en/article/about-collection-permissions) issue. When in preview, you are performing operations on your collection as the Admin. On the published site, you may be performing those operations with a role that is not permitted to perform those operations on that collection.\n\nAlso make sure that you [synced](https://support.wix.com/en/article/syncing-data-between-sandbox-and-live-database-collections) your Sandbox collection with your Live collection." },
