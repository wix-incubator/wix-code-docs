# About Velo

Velo is a full-stack development platform that empowers you to rapidly build, manage and deploy professional web apps. It allows you to develop smarter and deliver faster.

This **Getting Started** walks you through many of Velo's core features and gives you a great foundation to build on.

We cover everything from the basics of writing code that works with page elements to the advanced functionality you can build using backend code. Along the way, we introduce you to some of the mostly commonly used Velo APIs and some of the tools you can use to build, test, and monitor your site.

Each topic we examine here contains an explanation and an example that deals with the main uses of the API or feature being discussed. Often, we will also point you to other Velo resources where you can explore any details we've omitted here.

We will also use a fully-built, functioning site to demonstrate the concepts that you're learning. Use the site to get a better feel for how Velo is used in a real-world situation.Â 

### Prerequisites

We assume that you're already familiar with the basic functionality of the Wix Editor, such as creating pages and adding page elements. If you haven't been introduced to the Editor yet, you can read all about it in the [Help Center](https://support.wix.com/en/the-wix-editor/editor-basics).

We also assume that you have a working knowledge of JavaScript. If you know what a Promise is, you know the difference between false and falsy, and you think at least some of the JavaScript jokes you see online are funny, you should be fine.
