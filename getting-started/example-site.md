# Example Site

We use two types of examples to demonstrate the concepts that you're learning. 

-   While explaining the concept, we include a stand-alone example that illustrates the concept in a clear, concise fashion. 
-   After the concept has been fully explained, we present examples from a fully functioning site so you can see how the concept is used in context.

## Story

The site we created, [Give & Get](https://www.wix.com/velo-dev/giveandget), is a give and take marketplace for passing on used items to a new owner. You can explore and work on your own version of this site using [this template](https://editor.wix.com/html/editor/web/renderer/new?siteId=bc57d791-a42d-4f8c-b74e-bd51b6dd0095&metaSiteId=398bcfa9-b93e-435a-95ea-9a0c15d56d36&autoDevMode=true).

The Give & Get site allows logged-in members to post giveaways that they want to give away. Visitors to the site can request those giveaways and have them delivered. 

We used Velo in conjunction with the [Content Manager](https://learn.wix.com/en/) to build the following features into the site:

-   Search and filter: Visitors can find giveaways by keywords and by category and then get a giveaway.
-   Member generated content: Members can upload giveaways and can see and edit all the giveaways they've uploaded.
-   Integration with a 3rd-party service: Integration with a (fictitious) delivery service to delivery giveaways from the giver to the taker.

As we discuss Velo topics, we'll point out how they are used to build the functionality of the site.

## Components

Here's a bit more detail about the components that make up the site. Feel free to read about them here or just poke around the site to get a better feel for what it does and how it was built.

### Apps

Our site only allows logged-in members to upload giveaways, so we've added the [Members Area](https://support.wix.com/en/article/about-members-area) app.

The data is stored in the following collections with the permissions listed here:
