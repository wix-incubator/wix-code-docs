The Roles API provides functionality for managing roles of group [members](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-members-v2). 
 
With the Roles API, you can:
- [Assign](/roles/assign-role) a role to specific group members.
- [Unassign](/roles/unassign-role) a role from specific group members.


> **Note:** This module is only relevant for site admins and group admins.


To use the Roles API, import `{ roles }` from the `wix-groups.v2` module. 

```javascript
import { roles } from 'wix-groups.v2';
```

## Before you begin
Before you begin coding, make sure to add the [Wix Groups](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-groups-adding-and-setting-up-wix-groups) application to your site. 


## Terminology

- **Site Admin**: A site owner or site collaborator with admin permissions.
- **Group Member**: A site member belonging to a group.
- **Group Admin**: A group member that was assigned the 'group admin' role by either the site admin, or another group admin. The creator of a group is automatically a group admin. The group admin has the same permissions as a site admin, but only for the specified group.
