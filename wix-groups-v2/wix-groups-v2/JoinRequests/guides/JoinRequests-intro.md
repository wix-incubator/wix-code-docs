The JoinRequests API provides functionality for managing requests to join a group.

> **Notes:** 
+ This module is only relevant for private groups. 
+ When a group's `privacyStatus` is updated from `PRIVATE` to `PUBLIC`, all pending join requests for that group are automatically approved.
+ When a group's `privacyStatus` is updated from `PRIVATE` to `SECRET`, all pending join requests for that group are automatically rejected. 
+ A site member can only join a group if they have a [public profile]("https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-groups-member-privacy-settings-for-groups").
  
### Settings for Typical Use Case
+ Group members with group admin permissions determine who can join their group by setting their group [privacy level](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-groups-about-groups#your-groups-privacy-permissions).
+ If a group's privacy level is set to `PRIVATE`, a site member can request to join the group on your site's Groups List page.
+ Only site admins or group admins can approve or reject site member requests to join the group, unless the group setting `membersCanApprove` is set to `true`. 
+ **Note:** If the `suppressAuth` option is set to `true`, all permissions are overwritten, and all site members (including non-group members) can approve or reject site member requests to join a group. 
+ When a site member's request to join the group is approved, the member is added to the group. 
+ If a group's privacy level is set to `PUBLIC`, a site member can join the group (no request necessary). 
+ If a group's privacy level is set to `SECRET`, only site members added by an existing group member can join the group (no request necessary). 
 
The JoinRequests API provides functionality allowing you to:  
 + [Approve](wix-groups-backend.joinRequests/approvejoinrequests) requests to join a group. 
 + [List](wix-groups-backend.joinRequests/listjoinrequests) requests to join a group. 
 + [Query](wix-groups-backend.joinRequests/queryjoinrequests) requests to join a group.
 + [Reject](wix-groups-backend.joinRequests/rejectjoinrequests) requests to join a group.
