The Bookings Resources API provides functionality for creating and managing resources.

A resource is a business asset like a staff member, or equipment needed to provide a service. Each resource owns a schedule. The schedule defines the resource's availability using the business's default working hours. Resources have tags that you can use for grouping. For example, add a `"room"` tag for classroom resources, and an `"equipment"` tag for resources like computers and projectors.

With the Resources API, you can:

- [Create](wix-bookings-v1/resources/createresource) and [delete](wix-bookings-v1/resources/deleteresource) resources.
- [Update](wix-bookings-v1/resources/updateresource) a resource. 
- [Update](wix-bookings-v1/resources/updateschedule) a resource's schedule.


To use the Resources API, import `{ resources }` from the `wix-bookings.v1` module:

```javascript
import { resources } from 'wix-bookings.v1';
```

## Before you begin

It's important to note the following points before starting to code:

- There are 2 tags that are used by the Wix Bookings app:
    - `"staff"`: Resources with the `"staff"` tag appear in the Bookings app's **Staff** page.
    - `"business"`: The Bookings app creates a resource with a name and tag value of `"business"`. This resource owns a schedule that contains the operating hours of the business and cannot be deleted. This schedule is used when creating resources that use the businessâ€™s operating hours for the resource's working hours.
- You can have up to 135 active resources and an additional 135 deleted resources.
- A resource can have one schedule only.
- When updating a resource's schedule you cannot change the system tags used by the Wix Bookings app. Tags used by the app have the values `"INDIVIDUAL"`, `"GROUP"`, and `"COURSE"`.
