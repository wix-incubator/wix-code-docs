> __Note__: This module is [universal](https://support.wix.com/https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/api-overview/api-versions#universal-modules). Functions in this module can run on both the backend and frontend, unless specified otherwise.

The Activity Counters module allows you to keep track of site members' activity. See "Integrations" below for Wix App activities that are already counted.

The service allows public and private counters:
 - Public counters can be read by any site member.
 - Private counters can only be accessed by the site member who owns the counter.

The Activity Counters API gives you access to the counters on a site at a per-member, per-app level.

Counters are only activated when a site member actually performs the activity the counter tracks.

This means that the query and list endpoints for this API may return a large number of results, for sites with many members.

## Integrations

Activity Counters is currently integrated with these Wix apps and features:

### Wix Blog

Wix Blog counts blog posts, comments, and likes.

 - [Blog (API documentation)](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-blog/blog/introduction)

### Wix Forum

Wix Forum counts forum posts, comments, likes, and views.
 - [About Wix Forum](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-forum-about-wix-forum)

### Wix Members Area
