# About Labels

Labels allow site collaborators to segment contacts in their Contact List.
Contact labels are useful for targeting specific audiences
for email campaigns or bulk actions.

For more information on how labels are used,
see [Creating Contact Labels](https://support.wix.com/en/article/creating-contact-labels).
