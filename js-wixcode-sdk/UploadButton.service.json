The file types of the images, documents, videos and audio files that can be uploaded are listed [here](https://support.wix.com/en/article/supported-media-file-types-and-file-sizes)." },
      { "title": "How do I use an upload button on my site?",
        "markdown": "The typical file upload scenario is a two-part process. First your site visitor chooses the file to upload and then they trigger the actual upload. This usually requires at least two page elements, an upload button element and a regular button. \n\nThe site visitor chooses which file to upload by clicking the upload button and selecting the file in a native file chooser dialog. (The site visitor can only choose from the specified file type.) Then the site visitor clicks the regular button to trigger some code that performs the upload.
