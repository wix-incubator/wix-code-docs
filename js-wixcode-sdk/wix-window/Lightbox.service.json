    [ { "title": "How do I pass data between a page and a lightbox?",
        "markdown": "When you open a lightbox using the [`openLightbox()`](https://www.wix.com/code/reference/wix-window.html#openLightbox) function, you can pass an object containing data to be used in the lightbox. In the lightbox's code, you call the [`getContext()`](https://www.wix.com/code/reference/wix-window.lightbox.html#getContext) function to retrieve the data sent by the [`openLightbox()`](https://www.wix.com/code/reference/wix-window.html#openLightbox) function. \n\nWhen you close the lightbox using the [`close()`](https://www.wix.com/code/reference/wix-window.lightbox.html#close) function, you can pass an object containing data to be used by the page that opened the lightbox. This data is retrieved from the resolution of the Promise returned by the [`openLightbox()`](https://www.wix.com/code/reference/wix-window.html#openLightbox) function." },
      { "title": "When I open a lightbox using 'openLightbox()', my 'getContext()' function returns 'undefined'. Why?",
        "markdown": "The [`getContext()`](https://www.wix.com/code/reference/wix-window.lightbox.html#getContext) function only returns a data object passed if the lightbox was opened programmatically using [`openLightbox()`](https://www.wix.com/code/reference/wix-window.html#openLightbox). If the lightbox opened automatically when the page loaded or via a link from a page element, data will not be passed to the lightbox.\n\nMake sure **Automatically display lightbox on pages** is set to **No** in the [Lightbox Settings panel](https://support.wix.com/en/article/setting-which-page-your-lightbox-appears-on) in the Editor and don't set any element's link to open the lightbox. Instead, create your own method for opening the lightbox programmatically. For example, you can add a button with an [`onClick()`](https://www.wix.com/code/reference/$w.ClickableMixin.html#onClick) event handler that calls the [`openLightbox()`](https://www.wix.com/code/reference/wix-window.html#openLightbox) function." },
      { "title": "How do I close a lightbox?",
        "markdown": "Although you can open a lightbox using the top-level wix-window API with the [`openLightbox()`](https://www.wix.com/code/reference/wix-window.html#openLightbox) function, there is no top-level wix-window function for closing lightboxes. That's because once the lightbox is open, control is moved away from the page that opened the lightbox to the lightbox itself. Therefore, to close the lightbox, you have to call the [`wix-window.lightbox.close()`](https://www.wix.com/code/reference/wix-window.lightbox.html#close) function from within the lightbox's code." } ] }
