CSS allows you to customize the appearance of your website, from colors and fonts to sizes and positions 
of different elements. For additional information on CSS styling options, refer to the 
[MDN CSS reference docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS).

## Add CSS to your site

To get started, <strong>add a global.css</strong> file in the <strong>CSS</strong> section of your Page Code. 
CSS styles added to this file will apply to the selected classes throughout your site. 
To select a class to style, use the name of the component as it's referred to in Velo. 

For example, to change the background color of all buttons to red:
```css
.button {
  background-color: red;
}
```

Use inner classes to style specific elements of a component class. 
For example, use `.button__label` to style only the labels of button elements.

## Available classes

See which classes are already available for any element on your site by selecting the element and 
viewing <strong>CSS Classes</strong> in your code panel:
![CSS Classes in code panel](images/css_classes_code_panel.png "CSS Classes in code panel")

Or add your own classes in the custom classes field. For more information, see [CustomClasslist](/$w/customclasslist/introduction).
