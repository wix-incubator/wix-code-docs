Element structure and undocumented class names
may change without advance warning.
To avoid unintended style changes to your site,
select elements with the documented class names only.

## `.rich-text`

Targets text elements.

Text elements contain multiple text nodes,
each of which is wrapped in an HTML paragraph or heading tag.
You can select the entire text element with the `.rich-text` class.
For example:

```css
.rich-text {
  font-family: serif;
  color: orange;
}
```

## `.rich-text__text`

Targets the html text in text elements.
For example:

```css
.rich-text__text {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  color: black;
  font-size: 14pt;
}
```
