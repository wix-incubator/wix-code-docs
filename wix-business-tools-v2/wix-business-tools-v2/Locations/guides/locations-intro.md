With Locations, site owners can define multiple physical locations for their business. This allows them to set individual opening hours for each location.

The Locations API allows you to:

+ [Get](wix-business-tools-v2/locations/getlocation), [list](wix-business-tools-v2/locations/listlocations), and [query](wix-business-tools-v2/locations/querylocations) existing locations.
+ [Create](wix-business-tools-v2/locations/createlocation), [update](wix-business-tools-v2/locations/updatelocation), and [archive](wix-business-tools-v2/locations/archivelocation) locations.
+ [Set a default location](wix-business-tools-v2/locations/setdefaultlocation) that is reflected in the site properties.

Read more about how site owners can manage their [location-specific bookings](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-bookings-offering-services-at-multiple-locations).

To use the Locations API, import `{ locations }` from `wix-business-tools.v2`:

```js
import { locations } from 'wix-business-tools.v2';
```

## Terminology

+ **Default location:** Location reflected in the site properties. This location is used on invoices.
+ **Type:** Describes whether a location is an office, reception, branch or the headquarters.
+ **Status:** Indicates whether a location is `ACTIVE` or `INACTIVE`.
+ **Business Schedule:** Describes the location's regular and exceptional opening hours.
+ **Period:** Regular, weekly recurring opening hours of the location.
+ **Special Hour Period:** Exception to the location's regular hours. The location can be either open or closed during the Special Hour Period.

## Before you begin

Itâ€™s important to note the following points before starting to code:

+ The Wix Bookings API doesn't support the `businessSchedule` object.
+ You can't delete a location. Instead, you can archive a location using the [`archiveLocation()`](wix-business-tools-v2/locations/archivelocation) function.
+ You can't archive the default location.
+ Archived locations can't be unarchived.
+ The [`updateLocation()`](wix-business-tools-v2/locations/updatelocation) function replaces an existing location with a new location. Currently, you can't partially update a location.
+ Currently, the location type is just informational and doesn't affect a location's functionality.
+ The status `INACTIVE` isn't currently supported.

## Permissions information

Functions in the Locations API are restricted and only run if you elevate permissions using the `wix-auth` [`elevate()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-auth/elevate) function.
