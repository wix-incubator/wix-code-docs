The Wix Secrets Backend v2 API contains functionality for managing secrets you safely store in your site's Secrets Manager.

Velo's Secrets Manager allows you to securely store API keys and other secrets on your site. 
Each secret's value is encrypted, and assigned a name of your choice and an ID.
You can then use the name or ID to refer to the secret in your backend code rather than hardcoding its value.

Learn more [about Velo's Secrets Manager](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-about-the-secrets-manager).


With the Secrets API, you can safely:

- Manage secrets.
- Retrieve secret values.
- Retrieve other information about your secrets, such as their names and descriptions.

To use the Secrets API, import `{ secrets }` from the `wix-secrets-backend.v2` module:
```javascript
import { secrets } from 'wix-secrets-backend.v2';
```

Learn more about the Wix Secrets API in [Secrets Manager](/getting-started/integration-with-third-party-services_secrets-manager) in the Velo API Reference, and on [Wix Learn](https://www.wix.com/learn/online-course/coding-with-velo/velo-backend#secure-api-keys).

## Before you begin
It's important to note the following:

- You must set up a [Members Area](https://support.wix.com/en/article/site-members-adding-and-setting-up-a-members-area), before you can create or manage secrets with the Secrets API. The Members Area isn't required to retrieve secrets with [`getSecretValue()`](wix-secrets-backend-v2/secrets/getsecretvalue).
- Deleting a secret, or modifying a secret's name or value, breaks all code using the secret.
- You can't create or rename a secret with a name that's already in use.

**Security considerations**
- If you currently use private keys in your code, we recommend removing them. You can either create a secret with the Secrets API or the [Functional Testing](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-functional-testing-in-the-backend) tool.
- To prevent malicious users from accessing the values of your secrets, use them only in backend code. Avoid using secret values in frontend code.


## Permissions information

The following functions in Secrets are restricted and only run if you elevate permissions
using the `wix-auth` [`elevate()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-auth/elevate)
function:

- [`deleteSecret()`](wix-secrets-backend-v2/secrets/deletesecret)
- [`getSecretValue()`](wix-secrets-backend-v2/secrets/getsecretvalue)
- [`listSecretInfo()`](wix-secrets-backend-v2/secrets/listsecretinfo)
- [`updateSecret()`](wix-secrets-backend-v2/secrets/updatesecret)

<strong>Warning:</strong>

## Terminology
- **Secret**: Secrets are values that you donâ€™t want to be publicly accessible, such as login credentials or API keys.
- **API key**: An API (Application Programming Interface) key is a unique code used to authenticate a user or program when making a call to an API.
