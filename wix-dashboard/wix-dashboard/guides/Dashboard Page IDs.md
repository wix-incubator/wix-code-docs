# Dashboard Page IDs

When you use [`navigate()`](#navigate), you need to provide the page ID for the dashboard page you're navigating to. You can navigate to your app's dashboard pages or to dashboard pages built by Wix.

>**Note:** Currently, you can't use `navigate()` to navigate to dashboard pages created with [Wix Blocks](https://dev.wix.com/docs/build-apps/develop-your-app/frameworks/wix-blocks/about-wix-blocks) or to [dashboard pages created with the Wix Editor](https://dev.wix.com/docs/develop-websites/articles/coding-with-velo/frontend-code/dashboard-admin-pages/working-with-dashboard-pages).

## Your app's dashboard pages
The IDs for your app's dashboard pages correspond to the IDs for [dashboard page extensions](https://dev.wix.com/docs/build-apps/developer-tools/extensions/dashboard-extensions/about-dashboard-page-extensions) added to your app. You can find these IDs in the Wix Dev Center or your app's code files, depending on how you created your extensions:

* **Dev Center**: For extensions created in the Dev Center, you can find your page's ID on your dashboard page extension's configuration page. To open the page:
   1. Open your app's [**Extensions**](https://dev.wix.com/app-selector?title=Select+an+App&primaryButtonText=Select+Site&actionUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fdev.wix.com%2Fapps%2F%7BappId%7D%2Fextensions) page. 
   1. Find your dashboard page extension and click **Edit**. The page's ID is displayed under **Extension ID**.

* **CLI**: For extensions created using the [Wix CLI](https://dev.wix.com/docs/build-apps/developer-tools/cli/get-started/about-the-wix-cli-for-apps), you can find the ID in your dashboard page's `page.json` file.

## Wix dashboard pages
The following table lists IDs for dashboard pages added by apps built by Wix. Use these IDs to navigate between pages when using the SDK or when [adding a dashboard menu plugin extension](https://dev.wix.com/docs/build-apps/developer-tools/extensions/dashboard-extensions/dashboard-plugins/about-dashboard-menu-plugin-extensions). The table also includes site requirements necessary to make certain pages available.
