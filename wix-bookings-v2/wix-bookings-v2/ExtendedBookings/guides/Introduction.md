With the Wix Bookings Extended Bookings API, you can retrieve bookings for a site's services.  
 In addition to retrieving information about bookings, you also retrieve additional extended information, such as whether the booking can be refunded or rescheduled, and attendance for the booking.


 ## Before You Begin

 Before using any `extendedBookings` functions, make sure to [install Wix Bookings](https://support.wix.com/en/article/adding-wix-bookings-to-your-site) on your site. 


To use the Wix Bookings Extended Bookings V2 API, import `{ extendedBookings }` from the `wix-bookings.v2` module:

```javascript
import { extendedBookings } from 'wix-bookings.v2';
```
