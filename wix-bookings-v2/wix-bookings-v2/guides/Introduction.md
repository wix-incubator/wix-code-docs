The wix-bookings API allows you to manage bookings and calendar functionality on your site.

To enable bookings API functionality for your site, add the [Wix Bookings](https://support.wix.com/en/article/adding-wix-bookings-to-your-site) application to your site. You must upgrade your site to a [Premium Plan](https://support.wix.com/en/article/upgrading-your-site-to-premium-3066683) in order to accept bookings and receive online payments. To accept payments, see [About Accepting Payments](https://support.wix.com/en/article/accepting-payments-on-your-wix-site-7014346).


> **Note**: You cannot book a service in preview mode, or when logged in as the site owner. To make a booking, publish your site, then either log out of your Wix account, or open the published site in an incognito browser window.
