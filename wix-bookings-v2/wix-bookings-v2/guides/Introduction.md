The wix-bookings API allows you to manage bookings and calendar functionality on your site.

To enable bookings API functionality for your site, add the [Wix Bookings](https://support.wix.com/en/article/adding-wix-bookings-to-your-site) application to your site. You must upgrade your site to a [Premium Plan](https://support.wix.com/en/article/upgrading-your-site-to-premium-3066683) in order to accept bookings and receive online payments. To accept payments, see [About Accepting Payments](https://support.wix.com/en/article/accepting-payments-on-your-wix-site-7014346).

> **Note:** This module is [universal](https://support.wix.com/https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/api-overview/api-versions#universal-modules). Functions in this module can run on both the backend and frontend, unless specified otherwise.




### Terminology


+ __Booking__: Information about the service that the customer has booked. 
  Includes details about the time, location, participants, and price.
+ __Service__: Online or in-person business offerings, such as courses and private sessions. For
  example, a fitness studio may offer a 
  1-hour yoga class, a 45 minute HIIT training session, and a 30 minute 1-on-1 
  personal training. Bookings offers 3 types of services: 
    + __Appointments__: Appointments take place whenever a customer books a specific 
      time slot. For example, your hair salon may be open for business from 9:00 AM 
      to 7:00 PM and a customer can book a session at any available time during the day.
    + __Classes__: Classes can be scheduled on different days, at different times, 
      with different resources, such as staff members. Customers can sign up for single sessions
      or a class's recurring sessions. For example, a language school offers a beginner's Spanish 
      class every Monday at 8:00 PM. Clients can join the session they want and don't have to commit
      to attending all sessions.
    + __Courses__: A limited number of sessions for the same service that starts and ends 
      on a particular day. Customers sign up for the entire course and not one session. For example, 
      a 12-session introductory course to Pilates, starting on February 1st and
      ending on March 17th.
+ __Schedule__: A collection of all sessions that belong to the same class, course,
  appointment, or resource. Schedules also comprise available slots that can still be booked.
    + __Session__: An _occupied_ period of time in a schedule. Sessions are the 
      building blocks of appointments, classes, and courses. Each of these types of 
      services comprise sessions. The collection of related sessions for a service represent the 
      service's schedule. 
    + __Slot__: An _available_ period of time in a schedule that can be booked by a 
      customer. While this includes existing sessions that are available for
      booking, it can also represent a period of time that can be booked based on
      the availability of a resource, such as a barber with appointments of 30 
      minutes each that are open for booking every weekday between 8:00 - 17:00.
      These slots are calculated according to the constraints of the schedule.
+ __Calendar__: General overview about the availability and bookings of the 
  business, including its services and resources. Manage your appointments, classes 
  and courses on the calendar.
+ __Resource__: Business asset like a staff member, room, or equipment that's 
  needed to provide a service.
+ __Bookings Policy__: Terms the business wants to enforce when 
  customers try to book a service. For example, how far in advance customers 
  may book a service or until what point before the start of a session 
  customers can cancel.
+ __Locked Sessions__: Sessions that customers cannot book due to business reasons, such 
  as the session being full and having a waitlist, or because an administrator 
  wants to manually screen each customer before adding a customer to a session.

> **Note**: You cannot book a service in preview mode, or when logged in as the site owner. To make a booking, publish your site, then either log out of your Wix account, or open the published site in an incognito browser window.
