## Before you begin

Itâ€™s important to note the following points before starting to code:

+ The `participantNotification` field holds only information about the last 
  message sent to the customer. It also doesn't include details which type of 
  message has been sent.
+ To use the Bookings V2 API, import `{ bookings }` from the `wix-bookings.v2` module:

```javascript
import { bookings } from 'wix-bookings.v2';
```
