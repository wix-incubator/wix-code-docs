With Wix Inbox v2, site contributors
can communicate with the site's visitors, contacts, and members
through Wix Chat, SMS, a Facebook business page, or other channels.
Visitor activities on the site and 3rd-party services
can also be displayed in Inbox conversations.

The Inbox APIs expose functionality for working with a site's inbox.
With the Inbox APIs, you can:

- [Send messages](messages/sendmessage)
  on behalf of the business or a visitor.
- [Retrieve conversations](conversations/getorcreateconversation)
  between a visitor and the business.

<!-- - Handle webhooks when messages are sent to [a visitor](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/inbox/messages/message-sent-to-participant-webhook) or [the business](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/inbox/messages/message-sent-to-business-webhook), when a [message button is clicked](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/inbox/messages/button-interacted-webhook), or when [conversations are merged](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/inbox/conversations/conversations-merged-webhook). -->
