This service allows you to read and delete abandoned carts, and listen to abandoned-related events from Wix Stores.

## Events

AbandonedCarts API events are fired on your siteâ€™s backend
when certain events occur with Abandoned Carts.
See [wix-stores-backend events](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-stores-backend/events)
for more information related to these events.

To use the Abandoned Cart API,
import `abandonedCarts` from wix-stores.v2:

```js
import { abandonedCarts } from 'wix-stores.v2';
```
