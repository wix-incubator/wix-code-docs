This service allows you to read and delete abandoned carts, and listen to abandoned-related events from Wix Stores.

## Permissions information

Functions in the Abandoned Carts API are restricted and only run if you elevate permissions using the `wix-auth` [`elevate()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-auth/elevate) function.

<blockquote class='warning'>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Elevating a function allows it to be called by any site visitor. Exercise caution to prevent security vulnerabilities.</p>
</blockquote>

## Events

Abandoned Carts API events are fired on your siteâ€™s backend
when certain events occur with Abandoned Carts.

for more information related to these events.

To use the Abandoned Carts API,
