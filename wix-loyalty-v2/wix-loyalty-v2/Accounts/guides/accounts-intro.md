The Loyalty Accounts API allows you to create and manage your customer loyalty accounts.

With the Loyalty Accounts API, you can:
- [Create](wix-loyalty-v2/accounts/createaccount) a loyalty account for a site contact.
- Manually [adjust points](wix-loyalty-v2/accounts/adjustpoints) in a loyalty account.
- Set up functions that allow loyalty accounts to [earn points](wix-loyalty-v2/accounts/earnpoints) through their actions.

To use the Loyalty Accounts API, import `{ accounts }` from the `wix-loyalty.v2` module. 

```javascript
import { accounts } from 'wix-loyalty.v2';
```

## Before you begin

Itâ€™s important to note the following points before starting to code:
- To create a new loyalty account, a customer must first be a site contact with a contact ID.

## Terminology

- **Account ID:** Every loyalty account gets a new account ID which is different from that customer's contact ID and member ID.
- **Transaction:** A loyalty transaction includes any activity that changes a loyalty account point balance, such as adjusting, earning, or redeeming loyalty points.
