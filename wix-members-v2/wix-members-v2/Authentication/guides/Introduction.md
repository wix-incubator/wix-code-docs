The Authentication API allows you to manage authentication for your site's members area.

With the Authentication API, you can:

- [Approve](wix-members-v2/authentication/approve) pending members.
- [Block](wix-members-v2/authentication/block) members from logging in. 
- [Register](wix-members-v2/authentication/register) and [login](wix-members-v2/authentication/login) members to your site.
- [Change](wix-members-v2/authentication/changeloginemail) a member's login email.
- [Send](wix-members-v2/authentication/sendsetpasswordemail) an email for members to set their passwords.

To use the Authentication API, import `{ authentication }` from the `wix-members.v2` module. 

```javascript
import { authentication } from 'wix-members.v2';
```

## Before you begin

Itâ€™s important to note the following points before starting to code:
- You must add the Members Area app on your site. 
- The `register()` function's behavior depends on your site's [member signup settings](https://dev.wix.com/docs/develop-websites/articles/wix-apps/wix-members/enabling-custom-site-registration). You can set your signup settings to either automatically or manually approve newly registered members. 
    | SIGNUP SETTING         | RESULT                                                               |
    | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **Automatic approval** | &bull; Member `status` is `"ACTIVE"`.<br> &bull; Members can log into the site, or you can log members in by passing the returned `approvalToken` to [`applySessionToken`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-members-frontend/authentication/applysessiontoken)                                          |
    | **Manual approval**    | &bull; Member `status` is `"PENDING"`. <br> &bull; Members must be approved. You can approve members by passing the `approvalToken` to [`approve()`](wix-members-v2/authentication/approve)  |


## Permissions information

Functions in the Authentication API are restricted and only run if you elevate permissions using the `wix-auth` [`elevate()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-auth/elevate) function.

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Elevating a function allows it to be called by any site visitor. Exercise caution to prevent security vulnerabilities.</p>

## Terminology

- **Members:** Site visitors who have signed up as members through your site's [Member Signup Form](https://support.wix.com/en/article/about-the-member-signup-form). Members have their own profiles and can interact with other members of the site community.
- **Site Community:** A platform on your site where members can interact with eachother.
