The Members API allows you to create and manage a site's members.

With the Members API, you can:
- [Create](wix-members-v2/members/createmember), [update](wix-members-v2/members/updatemember), and [delete](wix-members-v2/members/deletemember) site members.
- [Retrieve](wix-members-v2/members/querymembers) member's information from your site.
- [Add](wix-members-v2/members/joincommunity) the currently logged in member to your site's community, or [remove](wix-members-v2/members/leavecommunity) the member from your site's community. 
- [Clear](wix-members-v2/deletememberaddress) a member's contact information such as their addresses, phone numbers, and emails. 

To use the Members API, import `{ members }` from the `wix-members.v2` module. 

```javascript
import { members } from 'wix-members.v2';
```

## Before you begin

Itâ€™s important to note the following points before starting to code:
- You must add the Members Area app on your site. 

## Permissions information

The following functions in Members are restricted and only run if you elevate permissions
using the `wix-auth` [`elevate()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-auth/elevate)
function:
- [createMember()](wix-members-v2/members/createmember)
- [deleteMember()](wix-members-v2/members/deletemember)

## Terminology

- **Members:** Site visitors who have signed up as members through your site's [Member Signup Form](https://support.wix.com/en/article/about-the-member-signup-form). Members have their own profiles and can interact with other members of the site community.
- **Site Community:** A platform on your site where members can interact with eachother.
