The Campaigns API provides functionality for managing your email marketing campaigns. 

With the Campaigns API you can: 

- [Get](wix-email-marketing-v2/campaigns/getcampaign) or [list](wix-email-marketing-v2/campaigns/listcampaigns) email campaigns.
- [Create a draft copy](wix-email-marketing-v2/campaigns/reusecampaign) of an existing campaign. 
- [Permanently delete](wix-email-marketing-v2/campaigns/deletecampaign) a campaign. 
- [List statistics](wix-email-marketing-v2/campaigns/liststatistics) and [list recipients](wix-email-marketing-v2/campaigns/listrecipients) of campaigns.
- [Pause](wix-email-marketing-v2/campaigns/pausescheduling) a scheduled campaign.
- [Publish](wix-email-marketing-v2/campaigns/publishcampaign) a campaign or [send a test](wix-email-marketing-v2/campaigns/sendtest) email.


To use the Campaigns API, import `campaigns` from the `wix-email-marketing.v2` module:

```js
import { campaigns } from `wix-email-marketing.v2`;
```

## Permissions information

Functions in the Campaign API are restricted and only run if you elevate permissions using the `wix-auth` [`elevate()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-auth/elevate) function.
