The Sender Details API contains the information that is displayed as the senderâ€™s name and email address when sending an email from your Wix site. 

With the Sender Details API you can: 
- [Get](wix-email-marketing-v2/senderdetails/getsenderdetails) your email sender details.
- [Update](wix-email-marketing-v2/senderdetails/updatesenderdetails) your email sender details.
- [Verify](wix-email-marketing-v2/senderdetails/verifyemail) your sender email address.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, it is important to note the following information. 

If you send an email campaign with a public email domain (e.g. @gmail.com or @yahoo.com), the email address isn't displayed in the 'from' header. Instead, the email address is replaced with @wixemails.com (or @wixsitemail.com for free users), and the sender's email is placed in the 'reply-to' header.

If you send an email campaign with an email from a Wix managed domain, that email will be displayed in the 'from' header. If you send an email from a custom domain that is not managed by Wix, a line will be inserted that states that the email was sent via wixemails.com.

To use the Sender Details API, import `{ senderDetails }` from the `wix-email-marketing.v2` module:

```js
import { senderDetails } from `wix-email-marketing.v2`; 
```

## Permissions information

Functions in the Sender Details API are restricted and only run if you elevate permissions using the `wix-auth` [`elevate()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-auth/elevate) function.
