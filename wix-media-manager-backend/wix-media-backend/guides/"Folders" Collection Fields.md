# "Folders" Collection Fields







When you add a file from your Media Manager to your site, the 'Folders' collection is automatically added to your site.

To use the Folders collection in code, refer to it as `"Media/Folders"`.

```javascript
wixData.query("Media/Folders")
  .find()
  .then( (results) => {
    // handle the results
  } );
```

> Note:
> When using this collection, you can't set up the site to [link to the next or previous dynamic page](https://support.wix.com/en/article/linking-to-a-dynamic-page#linking-to-the-next-or-previous-dynamic-page).
