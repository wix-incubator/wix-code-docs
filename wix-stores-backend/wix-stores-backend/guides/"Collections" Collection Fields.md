# "Collections" Collection Fields







To use the Collections collection in code, refer to it as `"Stores/Collections"`.

```javascript
wixData.query("Stores/Collections")
  .find()
  .then( (results) => {
    // handle the results
  } );
```

This document describes the permissions and fields in your Collections collection.
