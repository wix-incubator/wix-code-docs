# Introduction

Use the Pro Gallery Backend API to create and manage your pro gallery. To enable pro gallery backend API functionality for your site, [add a Pro Gallery to your site](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-pro-gallery-adding-and-setting-up-your-gallery). 

You can use the Pro Gallery Backend API to do the following:
+ Create a pro gallery from scratch, or clone an existing pro gallery.
+ Get, update, and delete an existing pro gallery.
+ Create, get, update, and delete a pro gallery item. 
+ List pro galleries and list media items in a specific pro gallery. 

## When a gallery is deleted
## List functions up to 10 galleries but info is still there
## List items up to 100
## Cloning a gallery - all props except for x
## sortOrder for gallery & item 

## media items are images, video, and text- need to be uploaded into media manager first
