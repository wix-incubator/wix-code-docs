The Pro Gallery API provides functionality for managing your pro gallery from the backend. Use the API to create, get, delete, update, and list galleries and gallery items. 


To use the Pro Gallery API, import `proGallery` from the `wix-pro-gallery-backend` module:

```js
import { proGallery } from 'wix-pro-gallery-backend';
```
