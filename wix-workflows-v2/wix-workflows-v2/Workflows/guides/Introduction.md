This service allows you to manage workflows, including creating, deleting, and updating workflows.

## Permissions information

Functions in the Workflows API are restricted and only run if you elevate permissions using the `wix-auth` [`elevate()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-auth/elevate) function.

<blockquote class='warning'>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Elevating a function allows it to be called by any site visitor. Exercise caution to prevent security vulnerabilities.</p>

To use the Workflows API,
import `workflows` from wix-workflows.v2:

```js
import { workflows } from 'wix-workflows.v2';
```
