The Orders API allows you to manage and track ticket orders.

With the Orders API you can:

- Get a list of all orders.
- Get an order's information.
- Update an order or change its status.
- Get a summary of total ticket sales.

## Before you begin

Itâ€™s important to note the following points before starting to code:  

- To use the Orders API, import `orders` from `wix-events.v2`:

```js
import { orders } from 'wix-events.v2';
```

## Permissions information

The following functions in the Orders API are restricted and only run if you elevate permissions using the `wix-auth` [`elevate()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-auth/elevate) function:

- `bulkUpdateOrders()`
- `confirmOrder()`
- `updateOrder()`
