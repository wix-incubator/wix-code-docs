Wix events are gatherings that an individual or a business holds for a group of people. We refer to these people either as guests, participants, or attendees.

The Wix Events API provides functionality allowing you to:

- Get and query Wix event information.
- Create and update a Wix event.
- Copy a Wix event.
- Cancel and delete Wix events.

## Before you begin

Itâ€™s important to note the following points before starting to code:  

- To use the Wix Events API, import `schedule` from `wix-events.v2`:

```js
import { wixEvents } from 'wix-events.v2';
```

## Permissions information

The following functions in the Schedule API are restricted and only run if you elevate permissions using the `wix-auth` [`elevate()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-auth/elevate) function:

- `bulkCancelEvents()`
- `bulkDeleteEvents()`
- `cancelEvent()`
- `copyEventV2()`
- `createEventV2()`
- `deleteEvent()`
- `publishDraftEvent()`
- `queryEventsV2()`
- `updateEvent()`
