# Introduction

With the RSVP API you can access the information on guests who have RSVP'ed to an event. This API is useful for managing guests lists and to see who has already checked into an event.    

When a guest responds to a RSVP registration form, a new RSVP is created and a confirmation email is sent.    

If you limit the number of guests, the registration will close once the guest list reaches capacity. You have the option to enable a waitlist, allowing site visitors to sign up and receive email notifications when additional space becomes available for the event.    

With the RSVP API you can:

- Create, delete, and update RSVPs.
- Check-in guests.
- Get the information about RSVPs.

## Before you begin

Itâ€™s important to note the following points before starting to code:  

- Install the **Wix Events & Tickets** app from [Wix App Market](https://www.wix.com/app-market/wix-events?referral=category&appIndex=5&referralTag=booking--events).
- Once you create an RSVP event, it can't be updated to a ticketed event.
- To use the RSVP API, import `{ rsvp }` from the `wix-events.v2` module:

```javascript
import { rsvp } from 'wix-events.v2';
```

## Terminology
