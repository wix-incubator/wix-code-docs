The Tickets API allows you to manage tickets for your site's events.

With the Checkout API you can:

- Access and update the tickets for an event.
- Check in tickets, and delete ticket check-ins.


To use the Tickets API,
import `tickets` from wix-events.v2:

```js
import { tickets } from 'wix-events.v2';
```
