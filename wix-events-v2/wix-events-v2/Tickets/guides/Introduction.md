The Tickets API allows you to manage tickets for your site's events.

With the Tickets API you can:

- Access and update the tickets for an event.
- Check in tickets, and delete ticket check-ins.

## Before you begin

Itâ€™s important to note the following points before starting to code:  

- To use the Tickets API, import `{ tickets }` from `'wix-events.v2'`:

```js
import { tickets } from 'wix-events.v2';
```
