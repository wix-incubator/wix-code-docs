The Schedule Bookmarks API allows you to bookmark a schedule item for a current member.

With the Schedule Bookmarks API you can:

- Create and delete a bookmark.
- Get a list of all bookmarks for a member.

## Before you begin

Itâ€™s important to note the following points before starting to code:  

- To use the Schedule Bookmarks API, import `scheduleBookmarks` from `wix-events.v2`:

```js
import { scheduleBookmarks } from 'wix-events.v2';
```

## Permissions information

The following functions in the Schedule Bookmarks API are restricted and only run if you elevate permissions using the `wix-auth` [`elevate()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-auth/elevate) function:

- `createBookmark()`
- `deleteBookmark()`
