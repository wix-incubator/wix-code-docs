With the Schedule Bookmarks API you can allow members to mark their favorite [schedule items](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-events-v2/schedule/introduction) to curate their own personalized agenda for your event.    

With the Schedule Bookmarks API you can:

- Create and delete bookmarks.
- List all bookmarks per member.
