The Ticket Definitions API allows you to manage ticket definitions for tickets to your site's events.

With the Ticket Definitions API you can:

- Create and update the ticket definitions for tickets to an event.
- Change the currency used for event tickets.
- Get ticket settings information.

## Before you begin

Itâ€™s important to note the following points before starting to code:  

- To use the Ticket Definitions API, import `{ ticketDefinitions }` from `'wix-events.v2'`:

```js
import { ticketDefinitions } from 'wix-events.v2';
```

## Permissions information

The following functions in the Ticket Definitions API are restricted and only run if you elevate permissions using the `wix-auth` [`elevate()`](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-auth/elevate) function:

- `changeCurrency()`
- `createTicketDefinition()`
- `deleteTicketDefinition()`
- `updateTicketDefinition()`
