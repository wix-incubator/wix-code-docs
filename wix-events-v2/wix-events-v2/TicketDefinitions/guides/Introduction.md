# Introduction

The Ticket Definitions API allows you to manage ticket definitions for tickets to your site's events.

With the Ticket Definitions API you can:

- [Create](wix-events-v2/ticketdefinitions/createticketdefinition) and [update](wix-events-v2/ticketdefinitions/updateticketdefinition) the ticket definitions for tickets to an event.
- [Change the currency](wix-events-v2/ticketdefinitions/changecurrency) used for event tickets.


To use the Ticket Definitions API, import `{ ticketDefinitions }` from `'wix-events.v2'`:

```js
import { ticketDefinitions } from 'wix-events.v2';
```
