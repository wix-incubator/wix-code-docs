>**Note**: These modules are [universal](/api-overview/api-versions#universal-modules). Functions in these modules can run on both the backend and frontend, unless specified otherwise.

[Wix Events](https://support.wix.com/en/article/about-wix-events) allows site owners to [create and manage events](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-events-backend/wixevents), including selling tickets, tracking orders and managing event policies.

## Terminology
- **Event** - a type of gathering an individual or a business holds for a group of people. Our APIs support the following types of events:
  - Ticketed events: Events which have tickets for sale (e.g., a conference).
- **Ticket definition** - the settings that define the ticket options available for purchase for ticketed events. Name, price and currency are required for each ticket definition.
- **Policy** - free-text that defines terms & conditions and other policies, as relevant.

> **NOTE**:  
A Wix service fee of 2.5% is charged for each ticket sold. This fee can either be passed on to the buyer or absorbed by the event owner.

The Wix Events APIs include:  
- **Tickets**: Manage purchased tickets.   
- **Ticket Definitions**: Create and manage the types of tickets available for purchase.  
- **Policies**: Create and manage event policies.  
- **Checkout**: Create and manage reservations. 
- **Orders**: Manage and track ticket orders.
