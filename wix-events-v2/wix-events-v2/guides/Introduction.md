## Before you begin

Itâ€™s important to note the following points before starting to code:  

- Install the **Wix Events & Tickets** app from [Wix App Market](https://www.wix.com/app-market/wix-events?referral=category&appIndex=5&referralTag=booking--events).
- A Wix service fee of 2.5% is charged for each ticket sold in ticketed events. This fee can either be passed on to the buyer or absorbed by the event owner.
- To use the `wix-events.v2` API, import the `wix-events.v2` module.

```js
import * from 'wix-events.v2';
```

## Terminology
- **Event**: A gathering organized by an individual or business for a group of people. Our APIs support the following types of events:
  - **RSVP**: Non-ticketed events for which guests indicate whether they plan to attend.
  - **Ticketed events**: Events with tickets available for sale.
  - **External registration events**: Events where registration occurs on a different website, and Wix only displays event information.
- **Ticket definition**: Settings defining the ticket options available for purchase for ticketed events. Each ticket definition requires a name, price, and currency.
- **Policy**: Text that defines terms & conditions, as relevant.
- **Guest**: The individual who has been invited to the event.
- **Ticket buyer**: An individual who purchases 1 or more tickets to the event.
- **Check-in:** The process of verifying a guest's attendance at the event.
- **Guest list**: A summary of all guests who have been invited to the event.
- **Organizer**: The person or entity responsible for planning and hosting the event.
- **Event Dashboard**: Control center, which allows you to manage your site events settings and features.
- **Checkout form**: The final step in the ticket purchasing process where the customer fills in personal info, reads policies, and pays.
