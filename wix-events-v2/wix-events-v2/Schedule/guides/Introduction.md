# Introduction

With the Schedule API you can share the lineup of the event and show what's on. Guests can make a personalized agenda with their chosen items by [bookmarking them](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-events-v2/schedulebookmarks/introduction). The created schedule will appear on your Event Details page.    

With the Schedule API you can:

- Add, delete, update schedule items.
- Adjust time of all draft schedule items at once.
- Publish or discard draft schedule.
- Get the information about schedules.

## Before you begin

Itâ€™s important to note the following points before starting to code:  

- Install the **Wix Events & Tickets** app from [Wix App Market](https://www.wix.com/app-market/wix-events?referral=category&appIndex=5&referralTag=booking--events).
- To use the Schedule API, import `{ schedule }` from the `wix-events.v2` module:

```javascript
import { schedule } from 'wix-events.v2';
```
